This is a computational model associated with the paper "Shaping of a three-dimensional carnivorous trap through modulation of a planar growth mechanism", by Lee KJI, Bushell C, Koide Y, Fozard JA, Piao C, Yu M, et al., appearing in PLoS Biol 17(10): [e3000427](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000427).

The models are:

GPT\_Utricularia\_trap\_model\_Fig\_9\_10\_11\_S5\_S7\_20190722  GPT\_Utricularia\_trap\_model\_Fig\_4\_6\_7\_12\_S3\_20190722

The models can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires a current installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
